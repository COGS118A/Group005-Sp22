        "As our daily routines depend more on mobile apps, apps with high ratings can suggest different meanings like how entertaining apps are or how helpful they are in our lives. Certain apps may become more popular as users give higher ratings, and people are more willing to download and use apps with higher ratings. Different models have been used to predict app ratings, such as Random Forest Regressor or XGboost models used to predict Google Apps Rating in this dataset<sup>[1](#1)</sup>. Such predictions take into account of areas like app category, price, content rating, number of installs, or reviews to see what features influence the ratings more. An area of ongoing research in machine learning is natural language processing, which is a field that uses algorithms for detecting words in sentences and interpreting the semantics behind the way the words were phrased. Natural language processing could potentially be used to analyze app ratings when considering users' reviews, but not much has actually been done to determine how 'good' or how high of a rating the application deserves based on the pattern between the words used in reviews and the rating given<sup>[2](#2)</sup>. Linear regression is one of the most popular and most widely used algorithms. Being one of the oldest techniques, we can also say that it is one of those algorithms which have been studied immensely to understand and implement. Hence you will find a million different implementations and names for Linear Regression<sup>[3](#3)</sup>."

        "The problem we are solving is predicting an app's rating, which is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable, by analyzing which components of an app predict/impact its rating more accurately as well as to what degree. By finding which components have the most effect, we can come to understand the features that constitute to an app's success and hence eliminate aspects of an app that drag down its ratings. Predictions of app ratings are quantifiable and measurable as they are measured in a mathematical scale. It is replicable because we can calculate the ratings based on differences in an app's features. Some ML-relevant potential solutions are Ordinary Least Squares, one-hot encoding, data wrangling, linear regression, and other Python functions.\n"

In order to implement this we will have to follow distinct steps, including creating a weight vector, in which we would have to calculate the optimum w that yields the minimum loss and taking the gradient. Something that will help us analyze the code is one-hot encoding, where we will have to transform categorical data to numerical to allow further analysis. After completing this, with other types of wrangling, we will implement linear regression creating a function that follows the mathematical computation. Some function calls that we will be implementing are numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn to compare different features that affect app ratings to ultimately see what variable has the highest correlation. Other than OLS and linear regression, we will implement gradient boosted decision trees using XGBoost and compare models using cross validation."

        "Since we are planning on using a regression model to predict app ratings from different features, one of the evaluation metrics we'll probably be using is the mean square error to determine the goodness of fit. Mean square error is calculated by the sum of the square of prediction error (expected output minus predicted output) divided by the number of data points, suggesting how far off our rating predictions are from the actual expected results. Another potential metric is using the mean absolute error, which is the same as mean square error except it takes the absolute value of prediction error instead of the square, to determine how far off our predictions are if we treat all errors the same. Mean square error will penalize big rating prediction errors more due to the square, but both metrics may be potential ways we could use to identify how good of a fit our model is.\n",
